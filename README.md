# Flip the Coin

## Overview

Flip the Coin is a simple, interactive web application that simulates a 3D coin toss. It features a realistic flipping animation and provides a clean, modern user interface.

## Features

- **Realistic 3D Animation**: The coin flips in 3D space with a smooth CSS-based animation.
- **Modern UI**: Dark-themed, polished interface with a gradient background and glowing effects.
- **Responsive Design**: Works on various screen sizes.
- **Controlled Outcome**: The logic currently contains a predetermined result for the flip, making it suitable for demonstrations or pranks 'see on line 217'.

## How to Use

1. **Open the Application**: Simply open the `coinflip.html` file in any modern web browser and you can edit on line 217 (heads or tails).
2. **Flip the Coin**: Click the "Flip" button to start the animation.
3. **View Result**: Wait for the animation to finish to see if it's Heads or Tails.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML5**: For structure and semantic markup.

- **JavaScript (Vanilla)**: For handling user interaction and controlling the animation logic.
